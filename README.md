# 💜 Alexander Alemayhu 👨🏾‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile page! Appreciate you taking the time to check it out 😃

For my active projects in development checkout the [2anki - organization](https://github.com/2anki). My main focus for now is 2anki.net which is my biggest side project. Of course I would like to build more and [SliceR](https://github.com/alemayhu/slicer) is a much more ambitious project that is still in research progress. It's going to be a wild ride building a web browser 😁


When I am not coding you can probably find me in the gym or running up stairs 🙂 This photo is from [RA](https://www.rablad.no/trappefolket-kom-til-tinn-3500-tegn-om-3500-trappetrinn/s/5-90-272614) the local newspaper for Tinn.
