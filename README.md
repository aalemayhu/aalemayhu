# 💜 Alexander Alemayhu 👨🏾‍💻

Hei there 👋🏾 I was born in Kenya (Nairobi) but now I'm a developer living in Norway.
I love learning new things especially about spoken and programming languages.

I have been writing code since 2010 and started working professionally as a developer in 2011.

Now a days I work as Web Developer but on my own time I am learning about web design, teaching, [Imba](https://imba.io/) and running.

You read right, running❣️ More recently I have discovered the joy of running 🏃‍♀️ The picture is from a fun workout with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trappefolket/?hl=nb">Trappefolket</a> 😁

I enjoy live streaming open sources projects on my Twitch Channel <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/alexanderalemayhu">alemayhu</a>. You should check it out 😉

I started out learning HTML / Python before moving on to C++ in order to make video games but left that to make a living with iOS applications. I've also dabbled in Android, Linux Networking, sysadmin stuff and security.

## 🕺🏾Passion Projects

My coach is training me to run a 10K under 40 minutes. So dreaming about doing a sub40 10k before Christmas hopefully 😅

For my coding projects, I am spending a lot of time helping out medicine students to create flashcards better and easier with Anki. It's really important for me that these tools are affordable to students, so I make them 100% free. No cost to usage for anyone anywhere in the world 🌎! My most popular project used by medicine students worldwide is:
